+ Delegate and Event
	+ events: you can encapsulate a set of mutable actions/actions and assign them to a third party
    + When the program is designed, we can divide the program into two parts: fix part and vairable part
    + Fix part is predefined, can not be modified;
    + Variable part can use event to implement an open interface, then the outside class can use them to extend the actions
    + Framework: complete the fixed/generic parts, leaving the variable parts with extension points to support customization
